List public repos
: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#list-public-repositories

Example, list the repositories for Caltech Library

```
curl https://api.github.com/orgs/caltechlibrary/repos
```

Generate GitHub access token
: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/quickstart?tool=curl

The following excerpt shows a session demonstrating this option.

> curl -X GET -u rsdoiel https://api.github.com/user/rsdoiel

Enter host password for user 'rsdoiel':

This option soon becomes tiresome, especially if you have a password
with high entropy. To mitigate the burden one could create environment
variables and use them instead.

For example, if you create the following environment variables

export GITHUB_USER=dvberkel
export GITHUB_PASSWORD=abcd1234

A request could be made with the command

curl -X GET -u $GITHUB_USER:$GITHUB_PASSWORD https://api.github.com/user



GitHub Pages
: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pages

Example list pages for datatools

```
curl  https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/datatools/pages
```
