Doiel, 2025-04-10\n\nThis an interesting use of an LLM, it means that the old \"advanced search\" UI or fielded search UI can be made to feel like a single box search, <https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/9/an-llm-query-understanding-service/ >. From Simon Willison's Weblog,\n\n> \"Many times, even a small open source LLM will be able to turn a search query into reasonable structure at relatively low cost.\"\n\nSo does this mean the huge Solar/OpenSearch indexes aren't needed?  Probably not but it does mean that we can build much more effective search and retrieval systems before requiring a full text search engine. Running an Ollama instance with an appropriate frugal model is almost trivial.\n",
