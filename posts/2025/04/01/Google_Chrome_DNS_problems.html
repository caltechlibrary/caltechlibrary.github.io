<h1 id="google-chrome-and-dns-problems">Google Chrome and DNS
problems</h1>
<p>Chrome can be problematic. It is not as reliable as it used to be.
Recently we’ve run into issues where you can’t reach Caltech Library web
resources even through they are up and available via other browsers like
Safari. There are a couple things you can try before resorting to a
clean reinstall of Google Chrome.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Clear you browser caches, this is accomplished from the “settings”
page. Google seems to change its contents an layout regularly. You’ll
have to open the “settings” and visual inspect the elements to see how
to empty your caches.</li>
<li>Chrome’s less obvious chrome://net-internals settings page. This
page contains additional caches you can try to clear</li>
<li>If that doesn’t work remove Chrome completely then try a fresh
install (the solution that ultimately worked)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="removing-google-chrome-on-macos-completely">Removing Google
Chrome on macOS completely</h2>
<p>Basic idea.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Quit Chrome if running, you can check the “Force Quit” list to make
sure it’s not running</li>
<li>Locate the Chrome related directories and remove them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a description of using your mouse and finder to do the work.
The first part is easy the latter part more challenging as macOS really
doens’t like making this easy (shame on them).</p>
<h3 id="finder-approach">Finder approach</h3>
<p>Start up the Terminal App. Changing into the “Library” directory (aka
folder) open the folder in finder using the open command, open .. This
will let you see what is inside the Library folder (often hidden in the
regular finder view of folders).</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>cd Library
open .</code></pre>
<p>Remove the main application. You can use finder to find “Google
Chrome” and drag it to the trash.</p>
<ul>
<li>“/Applications/Google Chrome.app”</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to find and remove the following “Google” folders. Normally
the “Library” folder isn’t listed in your finder window. What I do is
start up “Terminal” then change directory into the library folder and
use the “open .” command. cd Library open .</p>
<p>Now we should be able to find these three folders and drag them to
the trash.</p>
<ul>
<li>“$HOME/Library/Google”</li>
<li>“$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google”</li>
<li>“$HOME/Library/Caches/Google/”</li>
</ul>
<p>The next back of folders are trickier. They may more may not exist.
The first two can be found using the finder and dragged to the trash.
The lasts two you have to search for. The “*” is a wild card. I find it
easier to locate them using the terminal and the old fashioned Unix
“find” command.</p>
<ul>
<li>“$HOME/Library/Caches/chrome_crashpad_handler”</li>
<li>“$HOME/Library/HTTPStorages/chrome_crashpad_handler”</li>
<li>“$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/CachedData/*/chrome”</li>
<li>“$HOME/Library/HTTPStorages/com.google.*”</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these folders are all in the trash you can empty the trash (make
take a little while).</p>
<h3 id="using-the-shell-commands">Using the shell commands</h3>
<p>While this is more typing (which you can minimize by cutting and
pasting) I found it less frustrating. These commands are all executed
from your Terminal window. You can cut and paste the lines one by one or
you can save them in a plain text file, e.g. “remove_chrome.bash” and
run them with the command “sh remove_chrome.bash”.</p>
<p>If you run the script is can a while (30 to 120 seconds).</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>#!/bin/bash

sudo rm -r /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/
sudo rm -fR &quot;$HOME/Library/Google&quot;
sudo rm -fR &quot;$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google&quot;
sudo rm -fR &quot;$HOME/Library/Caches/Google/&quot;

sudo rm -fR &quot;$HOME/Library/Caches/chrome_crashpad_handler&quot;
sudo rm -fR &quot;$HOME/Library/HTTPStorages/chrome_crashpad_handler&quot;
sudo rm -fR &quot;$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/CachedData/*/chrome&quot;
sudo rm -fR &quot;$HOME/Library/HTTPStorages/com.google.*&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can check to make sure everything is gone with the script.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>sudo ls /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/
sudo ls &quot;$HOME/Library/Google&quot;
sudo ls &quot;$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google&quot;
sudo ls &quot;$HOME/Library/Caches/Google/&quot;

sudo ls &quot;$HOME/Library/Caches/chrome_crashpad_handler&quot;
sudo ls &quot;$HOME/Library/HTTPStorages/chrome_crashpad_handler&quot; 
sudo ls &quot;$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/CachedData/*/chrome&quot;
sudo ls &quot;$HOME/Library/HTTPStorages/com.google.*&quot;</code></pre>
